I have no idea how to set things up, everything runs off my hopes and dreams.

## Table of Contents
- [openmediavault](./openmediavault.md) built on an optiplex 3070, used as my photo/video editing storage server
- [pikvm](./pikvm.md) mostly to wake my main pc up (WOL is broken) and access bios
- [remote desktop solution](./remote-desktop.md) to access my main pc from anywhere
- [tailscale](./tailscale.md) networks all my devices together so i can access them from anywhere
