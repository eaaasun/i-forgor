# Page transitions with animejs
don't tell anyone i used chatgpt for this ðŸ’€

### why not use a transition library like swup or barba?
swup/barba transitions much faster/smoother as they replace the content of the page instead of unloading current page/loading new page, but i have no idea how to make js work properly across pages so i needed a more native solution

## prerequisites
- [animejs](https://animejs.com/) added to your site
- basic animejs knowledge

## steps
1. grab code [here](./materials/animejs-page-transitions.js)
2. create new js file with it, link it across all pages you want to transition into/out of
3. add animejs code
4. everything else should be handled automatically
